RGB (ceiling) extra information present in file

Welcome to cub3d and you already have committed a folly. Follow the usage below:
1. map must have the suffix '.cub';
2. In clt just execute the program and map;
3. Map must contain all elements (sprites with 
cardinal orientation, proper walled map, and 
RGB notated instructions [numerical value]);

This game has no exit for now, so use ESC to finish the game (:

Welcome to cub3d and you already have committed a folly. Follow the usage below:
1. map must have the suffix '.cub';
2. In clt just execute the program and map;
3. Map must contain all elements (sprites with

Welcome to cub3d and you already have committed a folly. Follow the usage below:
1. map must have the suffix '.cub';
2. In clt just execute the program and map;
3. Map must contain all elements (sprites with 
cardinal orientation, proper walled map, and 
RGB notated instructions [numerical value]);

Welcome to cub3d and you already have committed a folly. Follow the usage below:
1. map must have the suffix '.cub';
2. In clt just execute the program and map;
3. Map must contain all elements (sprites with 
cardinal orientation, proper walled map, and 
RGB notated instructions [numerical value]);

This game has no exit for now, so use ESC to finish the game (:

Welcome to cub3d and you already have committed a folly. Follow the usage below:
1. map must have the suffix '.cub';
2. In clt just execute the program and map;
3. Map must contain all elements (sprites with 
cardinal orientation, proper walled map, and 
RGB notated instructions [numerical value]);

Welcome to cub3d and you already have committed a folly. Follow the usage below:
1. map must have the suffix '.cub';
2. In clt just execute the program and map;
3. Map must contain all elements (sprites with 
cardinal orientation, proper walled map, and 
RGB notated instructions [numerical value]);

This game has no exit for now, so use ESC to finish the game (:

Welcome to cub3d and you already have committed a folly. Follow the usage below:
1. map must have the suffix '.cub';
2. In clt just execute the program and map;
3. Map must contain all elements (sprites with 
cardinal orientation, proper walled map, and 
RGB notated instructions [numerical value]);

This game has no exit for now, so use ESC to finish the game (:

Welcome to cub3d and you already have committed a folly. Follow the usage below:
1. map must have the suffix '.cub';
2. In clt just execute the program and map;
3. Map must contain all elements (sprites with 
cardinal orientation, proper walled map, and 
RGB notated instructions [numerical value]);

This game has no exit for now, so use ESC to finish the game (:
